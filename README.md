# Steps of Steps

## Why can't steps have steps?

---

We humans love solving challenges. It is how we progress. Solving our own challenges teaches us an important wisdom; the knowledge
that we are equipped to fight the things we fear. It gives us courage to walk 
into the dark with trust in perseverance. 

***How do we tackle challenges?***

- if we are sure that we are equipped to solve the challenge, we 
immediately solve it.

- if the challenge seem to big, we break them down into smaller
pieces

This project aims to help users break down their challenges into smaller
and more manageable pieces.
