# Steps of Steps

## Why can't steps have steps?

---

We humans love solving challenges. It is how we progress. Solving our own challenges teaches us an important wisdom; the knowledge
that we are equipped to fight the things we fear. It gives us courage to walk 
into the dark with trust in perseverance. 

***What push people who love challenges away from challenges?***

- the challenge might be not challenging enough to be interesting
- the challenge might seem unsolvable

This project aims to structure challenge into a form where users
could get a broad overview of the steps to be taken, and get more
detailed steps when they feel lost and confused.
