# Challenge Breaker

## Break down your challenges!


We humans love solving challenges. It is how we progress. Solving our own challenges teaches us an 
important knowledge; the knowledge that we are equipped to fight the things we fear. It gives us 
courage to walk into the dark with trust in perseverance. 

***How do we tackle challenges?***

- if we are sure that we are equipped to solve the challenge, we 
immediately solve it.

- if the challenge seems too big, we break them down into smaller
pieces

This project aims to help users break down their challenges into smaller
and more manageable pieces which we call "mini elaborated challenges" which each could be
treated and interpreted as a challenge.

What you'll be able to do with **Challenge Breaker**:

**General**

- step into existing challenges and view their elaborated mini challenges
- step out of a challenge until outermost layer
- add more elaborated mini challenges to existing challenges
- remove existing challenges
- update name and description of existing challenges
- switch order of mini elaborated challenges
- track challenge completion by checking and unchecking challenges

**Persistence**
- save state of current challenge anytime you want
- be reminded to save the state of current challenge when quitting
- load previous challenge anytime you want
